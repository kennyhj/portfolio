# Projects

- MySQL, Tableau
- Exploratory analysis of historic nypd arrest data (2006-2023)
- Dataset from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data)
- Visualized metrics: the most common crime types, heat map of arrests, demographics of those arrested, and arrests per year, all on a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kenny.jeong/viz/NYPDHistoricArrests/NYPDArrestDashboard) that can be filtered by year

Final Conclusions:
 - Black men age 25-44 account for the highest number of arrests, despite being the 3rd highest population in NYC. This discrepancy highlights a possible racial bias in policing.
 - Arrest rates spiked in 2020 after about a decade of decline. I would suggest further stuidy into the effects of the covid-19 on crime

<img src = "images/song_quality_histplots.jpg" width = "500">

Final Conclusions:
 - Qualities we want for the next viral song: C# major key, high danceability, energy, 90-120 bpm, addition to many Spotify playlists
 - Further useful insights to pursue: genres, TikTok sound usage, and YouTube data
